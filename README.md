# Loose-Scripts
Lose scripts I've created and used for various small tasks. 

Parts Export - A script I wrote to export a collection of models in blender. In the script you can change the collection selected, when running the script it will take each mesh in the collection. Centre the mesh then export it with a named string taking the mesh name in blender and exporting it with a number and stuff. Automatically exports as fbx files for game engines into a new folder called export in the original files location.
